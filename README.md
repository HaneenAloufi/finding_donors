# Finding Donors for CharityML
Analyzed factors that influence the likelihood of charitable donations based on actual census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.
